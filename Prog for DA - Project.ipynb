    "\n",
    "I will create a data set by simulating a study of childhood obesity then model and synthesise the data using Python.\n",
    "The numpy.random package will be used. \n",
    "'•\tChildhood obesity will be measured for one-hundred data points across four different variables.\n",
    " •\tI will investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    " •\tSynthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    " •\tUse of Jupyter notebook to detail my research and implement the simulation. \n",

    "##### Types of variables:\n",
    "There are two types - categorical and numerical. Categorical variables are ones with names or labels. Examples of categorical variables include species of the Iris flower - Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica. For this project, the categorical variables are obesity and sex. Obesity will be labeled yes or no depending on output data and sex will be male or female. \n",
    "The four attributes\\variables for which values can be measured are age, BMI, weight and height.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### synthesise a data set\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthetic data, which retains the essential features of the actual data with some or all of the values replaced by simulations from probability distributions, can be a way of overcoming these difficulties\n",
    "Reference : Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality (2016-2017); 7, Number 3, 67–97; Practical data synthesis for large samples\n",
    "\n",
    "The general approach is to do traditional statistical analysis on your data set to define a multidimensional random process that will generate data with the same statistical characteristics. The virtue of this approach is that your synthetic data is independent of your ML model, but statistically \"close\" to your data. (see below for discussion of your alternative)\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, you are estimating the multivariate probability distribution associated with the process. Once you have estimated the distribution, you can generate synthetic data through the Monte Carlo method or similar repeated sampling methods. If your data resembles some parametric distribution (e.g. lognormal) then this approach is straightforward and reliable. The tricky part is to estimate the dependence between variables. See: https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Multi-dimensional_statistical_analysis.\n",

    "The advantaage of synthesising a data set are :\n",
    " - Enables suimulation to forcast for example customer behaviour.  \n",
    " - is that it can be used where it is difficut to obtain the source data given more stringent laws regarding legal, privacy and security.\n",
    " - more flexibility re more variability in the dataset to validate against various situations like different population sizes, different data distributions, various data quality issues like missing or invalid data...\n",

    "The disadvantage of synthesising a data set are :\n",
    " -  only certain properties of the data can be replicated. It is not possible to attain a perfect so therefore can only simulate general trends.\n",
