### Programming-for-DA-Project
### Project Title : Fundamentals-of-DA-Assignment re synthesising data. 
Aim : Ceate a data set by simulating a study of adult obesity then model and synthesise the data using Python and the numpy.random package.
2.Real life phenonomen : Adults who are overweigth which will be measured for one-hundred data points across four different variables.
3. 6 variables:  2 Categorical  - Obesity and Sex. 4 Numerical - age, weight, height and Body Mass Index(BMI).

### synthesise a data set
It shows the importance of using both statistics and plotting of data visually for data analysis to ensure comprehensice understanding of the data.

### Code language
Jupyter Notebooks using Python3

### Source of Data
Random data 
Need to import 4 files with the datasets. Link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet#Data
